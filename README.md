PlantUML QEditor is a simple editor written in Qt for [PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/index.html).

Beside Qt, you will need your own copy of *PlantUML*, *java* and *graphviz/dot*. The path to java and plantuml are configurable via the Preferences dialog. Graphviz should be installed so that plantuml can find it (there is no configuration provided for this in Preferences).

The editor is quite simple: it monitors the editor for changes, and, if any, runs plantuml to regenerate the image.

Plantuml is run using pipes, to simplify the interprocess communication.

If you want to save a specific image, export it via the File menu or using the CTRL+E/CTRL+SHIFT+E shortcuts. The image is exported using the current selected image format (SVG or PNG).

The editor also supports an assistant that allows easy insertion of code snippets into the editor. The assistant is defined by a simple XML and a bunch of icons, one for each snippet.
